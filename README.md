ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryancytso, and I did my undergrad at McMaster University in Biomedical Discovery and Commercialization.
Currently, doing a Master's of Biomedical Informatics at Queen's University, under Dr. David Berman 
Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, data science, and how it can be leveraged in healthcare and the pharmaceutical space.
